    <p> I developed a love for technology at the age of 5. For me it all just felt so intuitive </p>
    <p> I was not afforded the opportunity to be able to tinker as much as I wanted to. However, I never
       allowed this to stop me in my tracks. I  just found other means of doing such. I then fell for math and numbers.
       Something about 2+2 always equaling 4 was simply magical.
