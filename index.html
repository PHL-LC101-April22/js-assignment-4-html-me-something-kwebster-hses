    <p> I developed a love for technology at the age of 5. For me it all just felt so intuitive </p>
    <p> I was not afforded the opportunity to be able to tinker as much as I wanted to. However, I never
       allowed this to stop me in my tracks. I  just found other means of doing such. I then fell for math and numbers.
       Something about 2+2 always equaling 4 was simply magical.
    </p>
    <p> The Universe provided me with the privilegde to attend the High School of Engineering and Science.
       It was here that I began my career in technology. I took all the available computer science and math classes.
       I was also able to take up paid summer internships where I discovered I would not work for free.
       My living conditions didnt allow for me to be able to donate time for a only a cause.
